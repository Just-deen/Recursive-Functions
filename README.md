<i> This article is an original work and a result of thorough research and analysis by me to provide unique insights on recursive functions and does not contain AI-generated content. </i>

## Overview 
Some explanations may appear too verbose due to the intention of recalling a particular process or concept involved with the recursive function example, to help solidify your understanding. Also note that the term "nullish value" in this article specifically refers to "null". 

If you're familiar will the following concepts, this article should easily understandable. However, if you're not familiar with the following concepts then this deep dive into recursive functions can prove to be a bit challenging to fully grasp;


1. Call stack
2. Nested functions 
3. Nullish operator 
4. Control flow
5. Recursive functions 

If you're completely new to the concepts listed above then that's okay. 
I'll be breaking down each concept when I use them in the context of any explanation.
